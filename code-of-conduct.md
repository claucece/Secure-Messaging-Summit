# Code of Conduct

The Secure messaging summit is committed to fostering a positive and inclusive
environment for all participants of it. We are adopting the
[Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment for Members and Event Attendees set out by the Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment)
Participants in the summit are expected to adhere to all of the policies
described on that link. Violations of this policy will result in dismissal from
the summit and possibly future banning from future events.

Since we are running an online summit, we require that every participant
represent themselves by the name that they use for their professional work. No
participant can impersonate another person. In addition, any speech or imagery
that are posted in the chats or during any of the various activities must be
appropriate and in comply with the noted policy.

If you believe there has been a violation of these policies, or have any
concerns relating to conduct of participants at the event, we encourage you to
contact Sof√≠a Celi at cherenkov@riseup.net, or the designated support people
Jurre van Bergen. You can do this by sending an email to securemessaging2020conduct@gmail.com
and it will be forwarded to all the support people.
