# Secure Messaging Summit

Welcome to the Secure Messaging Summit!

This is a summit inspired by the [OTRv4 summit](https://petsymposium.org/2019/program.php)
made last year. It is a summit where people from different places
(academia, industry, open source implementation, and legal perspectives) talk
about the latest problems and advancements on the secure messaging sphere.

## Format

The event will be entirely virtual.

The dates are still been defined but it will either take place on the last
weeks of August or the firsts of September.

## Speakers (Dates TBD)

We will publish the list of speakers later this month; but manly the topics
vary from deniability, message franking, legal perspectives to state of the current
secure messaging clients.

There are many great people in this area, and we're sorry we can't invite all of
them. If this goes well, hopefully we'll have more of them in the future!

## How to Register

We have no idea how much demand there will be. We will provide a registration
form starting from August.

### Before you register

On the Internet, signing up is cheap. Showing up is hard. Check your calendar
to make sure you're free, and block off the dates: commit to participating
before you sign up. Do not sign up until you've blocked out the dates in your
calendar.

Nevertheless, we understand that things can change. If you have signed up but
won't be participating, let us know.

## Sponsors

This is nicely sponsored by NlNet.

You can be another sponsor if you like! ;)
