# Secure Messaging Summit

Welcome to the Secure Messaging Summit!

This is a summit inspired by the [OTRv4 summit](https://petsymposium.org/2019/program.php)
made last year. It is a summit where people from different places
(academia, industry, open source implementation, and legal perspectives) talk
about the latest problems and advancements on the secure messaging sphere.

This form takes inspiration from the [pl-hci-school-2020](https://shriram.github.io/pl-hci-school-2020/)
organized by Sarah Chasins, Elena Glassman, Shriram Krishnamurthi and Hila Peleg,
and by the [Fourteenth Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium, ANTS-XIV](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~sgal018/ANTS/index.html)
organized by Steven Galbraith.

## Format

The event will be entirely virtual.

The summit will run over two days, on the first week of September: **the 3rd and 4th of September**.
It’ll end up being centered around times convenient to the morning in the Americas,
the afternoon in Europe and Africa, and the evening in Western Asia. We are very
sorry with the people from Central, East, South, Southeast, North Asia and the
Australian continent. The next edition will prioritize the times for those
places.

The times, therefore, are:

* 3rd of September: from 8:45 NY time to ~14:15 NY time (from 14:45 CEST to ~20:15 CEST)
* 4th of September: from 11:00 NY time to ~13:30 NY time (from 17:00 CEST to ~19:30 CEST)

After each session, there will be a time for socializing, if wanted.

The schedule will be:

| 3rd                             | 4th                                        |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Talks from different speakers   | Panel around the legal/political aspects   |

## Speakers

The list of confirmed speakers for the 3rd are:

* [Rosario Gennaro](https://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~rosario/), from the City College of New York, with the talk:

  **The Simulation Paradigm and Deniable Communications**

  *In this talk, Gennaro will survey the area of Deniable Communication and the
  use of the Simulation Paradigm to define and prove what deniability is. He will
  discuss the fundamental differences between zero-knowledge and deniability
  simulations, and then focus on the specific application of deniable
  authentication and key-exchange. He will conclude by presenting recent work
  that analyzes the deniability of widely used messaging protocols, such as
  Signal.*

* Thomas Ristenpart from Cornell Tech
* Raphael Robert from Wire

* Nikolas Unger, from the University of Waterloo, with the talk:

  **What user studies tell us about secure messaging?**

  Are people concerned about mass surveillance? How do users perceive end-to-end
  encryption and people who use it? Did the Snowden revelations alter user
  perceptions of encryption? What security properties are important to users?
  What security properties do they erroneously expect? How do these concerns
  vary among sub-populations? Should we show ciphertext to users? What threat
  actors are users concerned about? How do we visually communicate security?
  What metaphors should we use for security and privacy? Does secure messaging
  make messaging secure? Why is everyone using Zoom and Telegram? How do people
  perceive SMS and landline calls? What happened to PGP? Is adoption of secure
  messaging limited by poor usability? How should we design trust establishment
  ceremonies? Are trust establishment ceremonies even important? Are the
  values of users and developers aligned?

  In the past 25 years, user studies have investigated the answers to these
  questions and more. This talk surveys the most notable results from user
  studies in the academic literature with respect to questions about the
  usability and deployability of secure messaging technology. These results do
  not tell the whole story, but they do provide useful insights for protocol
  designers and software developers.

* Paul Rösler from the Ruhr University Bochum

* Daniel Kales from the Technical University of Graz

The topics that they will present vary from deniability, message franking,
group messaging, mobile private contact discovery, and concurrent ratcheting.
Expect the abstracts for these talks to be published soon.

The list of confirmed participants on the panel for the 4th are:

* Moderator: Iraklis Symeonidis from the University of Luxembourg
* Danny O'Brien from EFF
* Erica Portnoy from EFF

There are many great people in this area, and we're sorry we can't invite all of
them. If this goes well, hopefully we'll have more of them in the future!

The talks and panel might be recorded prior consent from the speakers.

## How to Register

We have no idea how much demand there will be. We will provide a registration
form starting from August.

Registration will open on the 10th of August and end on the 30 of August. Times
for opening and closing registration will be on UTC-5.

Registration is free; but you must read and accept our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/claucece/Secure-Messaging-Summit/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md), and be aware of the [SNAPL Friendly Environment Policy](https://snapl.org/2015/policy.html).

We require that every participant represent themselves by the name that they
use for their professional work (this can be a pseudonym that they generally
use for their professional work). No participant can impersonate another person.

### Registration form

To be provided on the 10th of August at 7:00 UTC-5. It will close on the 30 of
August at 23:00 UTC-5.

### Before you register

On the Internet, signing up is cheap. Showing up is hard. Check your calendar
to make sure you're free, and block off the dates: commit to participating
before you sign up. Do not sign up until you've blocked out the dates in your
calendar.

Nevertheless, we understand that things can change. If you have signed up but
won't be participating, let us know.

## What we will use

* Zoom.
* Zulip: for chatting with other participants or with the speaker.
* Yotribe: for socializing after the sessions.
* YouTube: for posting the recorded talks, if consent was given.

## Who This Event is Not For

This isn't a place for people to be exclusionary or for harassment. This event
has a code of conduct and we’ll use the [SNAPL Friendly Environment Policy](https://snapl.org/2015/policy.html).

This is nicely sponsored by [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/).

You can be another sponsor if you like! ;)
